# SubwayFoodSystem
A self-service food system program where the user is allowed to choose ingredients of their choice for either lunch or dinner to produce a dish of their liking similar to the mechanism opted by the fast food joint - 'Subway'. The program uses linked list data structure for storing the preferences and a dynamic typing mechanism to make the program seem more visually appealing. It also shows the current date and time as of which the bill was generated.
